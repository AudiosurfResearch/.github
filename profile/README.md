# AudiosurfResearch
We are a group of people dedicated to taking apart the Audiosurf games to understand how they work.

Our most notable projects are:
- [Wavebreaker](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch/Wavebreaker), a custom replacement for Audiosurf's online services
- [Quest3DTamperer](https://github.com/AudiosurfResearch/Quest3DTamperer), a tool for examining Audiosurf (and potentially other Quest3D software) at runtime
